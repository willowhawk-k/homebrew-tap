      The Mac App Store build of NetLights is already installed.

      Both builds install to /Applications/NetLights.app, so only one can be present.
      Here is what changes if you switch to this (Developer-ID) build:

        GAIN  `netlights serve` — the built-in web UI. The App Store build is
              sandboxed without the incoming-connections entitlement, so it can
              never listen on a socket.
        GAIN  Updates via `brew upgrade`, and the in-app Sponsor link.
        LOSE  Automatic updates from the App Store.
        LOSE  App Sandbox confinement. This build is notarized and uses the
              hardened runtime, but it is not sandboxed.
        SAME  Everything else — the graph, `netlights tui`, all the tabs.

      To keep the App Store build and just get the CLI on your PATH:
          brew install netlights-cli
      (`tui` and `--dump-json` work there; `serve` does not.)

      To switch to this build: delete /Applications/NetLights.app (drag it to the
      Trash), then re-run:
          brew install --cask netlights

      To proceed without deleting it first — Homebrew will overwrite the app:
          NETLIGHTS_REPLACE_APPSTORE=1 brew install --cask netlights

  ]

  caveats <<~EOS
    `netlights` is now on your PATH:

        netlights            open the app
        netlights tui        live terminal dashboard (top-style)
        netlights serve      serve the web UI at http://127.0.0.1:8765
        netlights --help     everything else

    `serve` listens on loopback only by default. It has no authentication and
    publishes your interfaces, addresses, routes and DNS servers, so `--bind all`
    is an explicit choice. See https://github.com/willowhawk-k/NetLights/blob/main/PRIVACY.md
